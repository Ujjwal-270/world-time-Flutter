# TimeLink
TimeLink is a mobile application built using the Flutter framework, designed to provide users with real-time information about various locations around the world. The app offers a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, allowing users to view the current time and day/night status for different cities and regions.

Key Features:

1.Home Screen: The app's home screen is the main dashboard where users can view the current time and day/night status for a default location or the last selected location.

2.Choose Location: The Choose Location screen allows users to select a new location from a pre-defined list of cities. Each city is represented by a card displaying the city name and a flag representing the country. When a user taps on a city, the app fetches the latest time data for that location and updates the home screen accordingly.

3.Real-time Time Data: The app uses the WorldTime API to fetch accurate and up-to-date time data for different locations across the world. The time data considers the respective time zones and daylight saving time, providing users with precise information.

4.Background Images: The app dynamically changes the background image on the home screen based on the time of day. During daytime, a bright and cheerful image is displayed, while a darker image is shown during nighttime. This feature enhances the user experience and makes the app visually appealing.

5.Edit Location: The app allows users to easily edit the selected location by tapping on the "Edit Location" button on the home screen. This navigates them to the Choose Location screen, where they can select a new city or region.

How the App Works:

Upon launching the World Time App, users are greeted with a loading screen that fetches the initial time data for the default location. After the data is obtained, the app navigates to the home screen, where users can view the current time, day/night status, and location name.

Users can then tap the "Edit Location" button on the home screen to access the Choose Location screen. On this screen, they can scroll through a list of cities and tap on any city to view its current time and day/night status. Selecting a new city triggers an update on the home screen, displaying the time and day/night status for the newly chosen location.

The World Time App ensures a seamless user experience by providing real-time and accurate time data, along with visually appealing background images that change according to the time of day. With its user-friendly interface, users can effortlessly track time across different time zones and stay informed about the day/night status in various parts of the world.

Overall, the World Time App is a valuable tool for travelers, international professionals, and anyone curious about the current time in different regions, making it a handy and convenient application for global connectivity.
