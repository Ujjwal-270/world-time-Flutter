This code contains the data frame of the App.
It runs on 4  seperate pages for Navigating the app.
The code for the main file of the app goes as follows:-

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:world_time/pages/choose_location.dart';
import 'package:world_time/pages/home.dart';
import 'package:world_time/pages/loading.dart';

void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(
  initialRoute: '/',
  routes: {
    '/':(context) => loading(),
    '/home':(context) => Home(),
    '/location':(context) =>ChooseLocation()
  }
));


This code sets up a basic navigation system for this World Time App.
It defines three main pages (screens): Loading, Home, and Choose Location, and sets the initial route to the Loading page. 
The MaterialApp widget is used to create the app, and it provides a navigation structure using the routes property.
